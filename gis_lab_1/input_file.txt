The idea behind Huffman coding is based on the frequency of occurrence of a character in a sequence. The character that occurs 
most often in the sequence receives a new very small code, and the character that occurs least often receives, on the contrary, 
a very long code. This is necessary because we want that when we have processed the entire input, the most frequent characters 
take up the least space (and less than they occupied in the original), and the rarest ones more (but since they are rare, it 
does not matter). For our program, I decided that the character will have a length of 8 bits, that is, it will correspond to 
the printed sign.
